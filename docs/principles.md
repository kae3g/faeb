# faeb Design Principles
## RISC-V Paradigm Applied to Software Foundation

## Core Philosophy

### Minimalism (faeb)
- **Do less, but do it perfectly**
- Every component must justify its existence
- No feature creep or scope expansion
- Absolute focus on essential functionality

### Orthogonality (RISC-V Influence)
- Components work independently without side effects
- Clear separation of concerns
- No hidden dependencies or interactions
- Composable building blocks

### Verifiability (Mathematical Certainty)
- Formal proofs of correctness for all components
- Automated verification pipelines
- Reproducible build environments
- Cryptographic signing of all artifacts

## RISC-V Paradigm Translation

### From Hardware to Software
| RISC-V Principle | faeb Implementation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Minimal Instruction Set** | Minimal API Surface |
| **Modular Extensions** | Standard Extension Interfaces |
| **Open Standard** | Apache 2.0 License |
| **Formal Specification** | Coq/Lean Verification |
| **Performance Focus** | Efficiency Optimization |

### Extension Philosophy
1. **Standard Interfaces**: Well-defined extension points
2. **Safety First**: All extensions must be verifiable
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Never break existing extensions
4. **Community Driven**: Extensions can be developed independently

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- **Zero warnings**: All builds must be warning-free
- **100% test coverage**: No untested code paths
- **Formal verification**: Mathematical proofs of correctness
- **Documentation**: Every function fully documented

### Performance Requirements
- **Memory efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint
- **CPU efficiency**: Optimized algorithms
- **Startup time**: Instant initialization
- **Binary size**: Smallest possible distribution

### Security Standards
- **Memory safe**: No buffer overflows or corruption
- **Type safe**: Complete type system enforcement
- **Thread safe**: Race-condition free concurrency
- **Formally verified**: Mathematical security proofs

## Development Process

### Contribution Flow
1. **Proposal**: RFC for new features or extensions
2. **Implementation**: Code with tests and verification
3. **Review**: Community and security review
4. **Verification**: Formal proof development
5. **Integration**: Merge into main branch

### Quality Assurance
- **Automated testing**: Continuous integration pipeline
- **Formal verification**: Automated proof checking
- **Performance benchmarking**: Regular performance tests
- **Security auditing**: Periodic security reviews

## Evolution Principles

### Backward Compatibility
- Never remove existing functionality
- Deprecate rather than remove features
- Provide migration paths for changes
- Maintain extension compatibility

### Progressive Enhancement
- Start with minimal viable product
- Add features only when absolutely necessary
- Ensure each feature is complete and verifiable
- Maintain philosophical consistency

## Community Values

### Gentle Revolution Principles
- **Respectful**: Everyone's contributions valued
- **Inclusive**: Welcome diverse perspectives
- **Transparent**: All decisions and discussions public
- **Educational**: Focus on learning and teaching

### Open Source Ethos
- **Royalty-free**: No cost for usage or modification
- **Community-driven**: Decisions made by consensus
- **Documentation-focused**: Comprehensive learning materials
- **Quality-obsessed**: Uncompromising standards
